// 23.Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
//  console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//  console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
let six = 6;
let eight = 8;
// test 1
console.log("Test 1: six is equal to 6");
console.log(six == 6);
// test 2
console.log("Test 2: eight is not equal to 6");
console.log(eight !== 6);
// test 3
console.log("Test 3: six is  not equal to  8");
console.log(six !== 8);
// test 4
console.log("Test 4: eight is equal to 8");
console.log(eight == 8);
// test 5
console.log("Test 5 :six is less than 8");
console.log(six < 8);
// test 6
console.log("Test 6: six is greater than to 8");
console.log(six > 8);
// test 7
console.log("Test 7 : six is not equal to 6");
console.log(six !== 6);
// test 8

console.log(eight !== 8);
// test 9

// test 10
